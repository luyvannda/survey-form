Build a Survey Form (2nd edition)

Synopsis: The first survey form, I have ever built. I am doing it with a friend Omar in pair programming. The code works fine in local server. However, when uploaded into freeCodeCamp, some of the background css color are not working properly. Now I am revisit this survey form and rebuild css stylesheet from the ground up and fix html codes when necessary.

Developer: Luy Vannda

Revisit the survey form again for freeCodeCamp certification.
